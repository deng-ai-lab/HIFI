#  HIFI on general AI datasets
* Run run.sh to directly train HlFl with default parameter settings.
* Pre-trained spiking resnet18 with HIFI neuron on CIFAR10/100 can be download in [HIFI_SNN_CIFAR - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Y5THDunB5sc_wanHRe1A8JExuGZyzTn?usp=sharing). Run eval.sh to evaluate the accuracy and FLOPS after downloading the pre-trained weights.
* Our model is scalable for different network architectures and general for different datasets. The network architectures and the datasets can be replaced as you need.
